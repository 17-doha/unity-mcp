Follow this detailed step-by-step guide to build this **"Crystal Climber"** game.

---

### Step 1: Set Up the Basic Scene
1. Create a new 3D project named "Crystal Climber."
2. Add a large flat plane as the starting ground (this can act as the base of the climb).
3. Add a simple 3D cube or capsule as the player character.
4. Position the player on the ground plane, slightly above it (to account for gravity).
5. Add a directional light to illuminate the scene evenly.

### Step 2: Player Movement Basics
6. Implement basic WASD movement for the player (forward, backward, left, right).
7. Add a jump ability triggered by the spacebar.
8. Attach a third-person camera to follow the player (positioned slightly behind and above).

---

### Step 3: Build the Platform Structure
9. Create a flat, square platform (e.g., a thin cube or plane) as a prefab.
10. Place 5 platforms manually in the scene, staggered vertically and slightly offset horizontally (forming a climbable path upward).
11. Add collision to the platforms so the player can land on them.
12. Test the player jumping from the ground plane to the first platform and up the sequence.

---

### Step 4: Core Objective
13. Place a glowing cube or sphere at the topmost platform as the "crystal."
14. Make the crystal detectable so the game recognizes when the player reaches it.
15. Add a win condition (e.g., display "You Win!" text on screen when the player touches the crystal).

---

### Step 5: Visual Polish
16. Apply a semi-transparent material to the platforms (e.g., light blue with a faint glow).
17. Add a pulsing effect to the platforms (e.g., slight scale increase/decrease or opacity shift).
18. Change the scene background to a starry skybox.
19. Add a particle effect (e.g., sparkles or glowing dots) around the crystal.

---

### Step 6: Refine the Platforms
20. Adjust the spacing between platforms to ensure jumps are challenging but possible.
21. Add 5 more platforms (total 10) to extend the climb vertically.
22. Place a small floating orb or decorative object on one platform as a visual detail.

---

### Step 7: Audio Enhancement
23. Add a looping ambient background sound (e.g., soft wind or ethereal hum).
24. Attach a jump sound to the player (e.g., a light tap or whoosh).
25. Add a short victory sound (e.g., a chime or jingle) when the player reaches the crystal.

---

### Step 8: Final Touches for Devlog Appeal
26. Add a subtle camera zoom-in effect when the player touches the crystal.
27. Sprinkle a few particle effects (e.g., faint stars or mist) across the scene for atmosphere.

### Extras
29. Add a double-jump ability (e.g., press space twice) to make platforming easier.
30. Place a slow-rotating spike ball on one platform as a hazard to jump over.
